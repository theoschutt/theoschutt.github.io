I am a Physics PhD candidate and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at Stanford University's [Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC)](https://kipac.stanford.edu/) and [SLAC National Accelerator Lab](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/).

I am an observational cosmologist with work spanning instrumentation, theory and data analysis. During my thesis I have
- modeled and validated pixel-level systematics (primarily the point-spread function (PSF)) for the Dark Energy Survey's weak gravitational lensing analysis,
- developed novel analysis techniques for cross-correlations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and galaxy surveys, and
- designed, built and tested essential test equipment for characterizing Rubin Observatory's LSST Camera.

As a member of several large science collaborations, I am keen to work at the interface of these three aspects of our field -- instrumentation, theory and data analysis -- leveraging multi-wavelength datasets to advance precise and unbiased insights into the nature of dark energy and dark matter and the key astrophysical questions of galaxy formation and evolution.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at Columbia University in 2020, where I worked with Chuck Hailey and Kaya Mori on galactic X-ray astrophysics and detector R&D for the indirect dark matter detection experiment, GAPS.
